# FastFlatten: Hierarchy Collapser
This package adds a new utility shortcut to the Unity editor; Collapse the currently active hierarchy!
Normally it's easy to end up with a cluttered hierarchy after working in a scene for a while, and the same goes for the project view. 
This this package allows you to quickly get your bearings and focus on your current work.

## Getting started
The default shortcut to collapse a hierarchy is ***CTRL+G***, this can of course be changed in Unity's *Shortcuts* editor.

Pressing the collapse shortcut once will collapse all other items in the hieararchy while keeping your current selection expanded. 
\
Pressing the collapse shortcut a second time after this will collapse the active selection as well, leaving a completely flattened hierarchy.
